# Hi, I'm Vishal  ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ’»

<img src="LET IT SNOW!.png" alt="banner that says Vishal Desh" width="1000">

I'm currently in year 2 at UBC, Vancouver, BC. I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Science (Computer Science + Statistics) and Masters of Management.

I worked on several hackathon projects :computer: this summer and gained a lot technical skills for development. I worked with different frameworks and platforms to creat applications such as a dating app for developers which is a blend of tinder, snapchat and a programming language called scheme. I've worked with non profit donation web applications, Clones with React.js and several other projects to help people during the COVID-19 pandemic :microbe:.

I'm the Control Systems Lead at UBC Mars Colony Design team where I Lead design and development of high and low-level control systems for a Sabatier reactor intended for use on Mars. In the past I have worked on several robotics :robot: and software related projects and I had the opportunity to intern with a few companies. 

I'm currently looking for internships for Summer :sunny: (May-Aug) 2021. Feel free to reach out to me ðŸ“« !
