Hello Folks! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ’»

I'm a recent Bachelor of Science - Computer Science graduate from The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, and I'm currently pursuing my Master of Management.

This past summer, I worked on several hackathon projects, sharpening my technical development skills. Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work with various frameworks and platforms, including creating innovative applications like a developer-focused dating appâ€”a blend of Tinder, Snapchat, and the Scheme programming language. Additionally, Iâ€™ve built non-profit donation web apps, React.js clones, and other projects aimed at assisting people during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As the lead of Fennec AI, Iâ€™ve also gained valuable experience managing remote teams across different time zones, applying both technical expertise and project management skills. I'm currently seeking full-time opportunities for Winter 2025, and Iâ€™d love to connect with anyone interested in collaborating or learning more about my work. Feel free to reach out! ðŸ“«
