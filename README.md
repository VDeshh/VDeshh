# Hello Folks!  ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ’»
I'm a recent Bachelors of Science - Computer Science gratuate from The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC. I'm currently pursuing my Master of Management.

I worked on several hackathon projects :computer: this summer and gained a lot technical skills for development. I worked with different frameworks and platforms to creat applications such as a dating app for developers which is a blend of tinder, snapchat and a programming language called scheme. I've worked with non profit donation web applications, Clones with React.js and several other projects to help people during the COVID-19 pandemic :microbe:.

I'm currently looking for full time opportunities for Winter :sunny: Jan 2025. Feel free to reach out to me ðŸ“« !
